# Gear-Cube-Simulator
I partly invented the first Gear Cube Simulator in the world for cubers to use, aiding me to promote the speedcubing method invented by me in lliteral form.  Until now, this simulator still cannot correctly simulate the rotation of the edges. Thus, I will be extremely appreciated if you can help me with this!!
